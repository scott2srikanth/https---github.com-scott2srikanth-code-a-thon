                        <p>This is an open-source game. In order to create your own game, fix
                            errors in the current version, or make any other changes, you must begin with
                            <a href="https://github.com/codenjoyme/codenjoy">forking the project</a>.
                            The root of the repository contains the file <em>readme.md</em> with a description of next steps.</p>

                        <p>In case of any questions, contact <a href="skype:alexander.baglay">skype:alexander.baglay</a>

                        <h2>What is the point of the game?</h2>

                        <p>You must create a custom bot for the snake to beat all the other bots
                            by gathering the most points. Each player is playing on their own field. The snake can move
                            to blank cells in all four directions.</p>
                        <p>On its way, the snake can encounter an apple, a stone, its own tail and a wall.
                            If the snake eats an apple, it grows longer by 1. If it hits a stone,                            it shrinks by 10 cells. If it is shorter than 10 cells and it hits a stone, it dies.
                            If the snake runs into itself or a wall, it dies.</p>
                        <p>Each eaten apple gives the player bonus points 
                            equal to the size of the snake at the time when the apple is eaten. 
                            Points may be deduced for letting the snake die (by default, the value is 0, confirm this rule with the event organizer).
                            Points are cumulative. The winner is the player with the most points (within the predefined
                            time limit). A dead snake disappears immediately and a new one appears on the field.</p>

                        <p>Players <a href="register?gameName=snake">
                            register on the server</a> using their email address.</p>
                        <p>After that, they must connect <a href="resources/user/snake-servers.zip">from the code</a>
                            to the server via websockets. This is a Maven project and it is suitable for playing using JVM languages.                            For instructions on how to launch it, see README.txt in the root of the project.
                            It also contains all supported languages.</p>
                        <p>If a specific language is absent from the list, you'll have to write your own client (and then share it with us! Here: apofig@gmail.com)</p>
                        <p>Address for connecting to the game server http://codenjoy.com:</p>
                        <pre>ws://codenjoy.com:80/codenjoy-contest/ws?user=3edq63tw0bq4w4iem7nb&code=12345678901234567890</pre>
                        <p>Address for connecting to the game server installed in a local network:</p>
                        <pre>ws://server_ip:8080/codenjoy-contest/ws?user=3edq63tw0bq4w4iem7nb&code=12345678901234567890</pre>
                        <p>Here 'user' - player id, the 'code' is your security token, you can get one from the address
                            bar of your browser after registering/logging in.</p>
                        <p>After connecting, the client will receive a regular (every second) line
                            of symbols which are the encoded value of the field. Format:</p>
                        <pre>^board=(.*)$</pre>
                        <p>using this regexp you can bite out the line of the board.
                            Example of a line from the server:</p>
                        <pre>board=☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼             ☼☼      ☻      ☼☼            ☺☼☼            ▲☼☼            ║☼☼            ║☼☼            ║☼☼            ╙☼☼             ☼☼             ☼☼             ☼☼             ☼☼             ☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼</pre>
                        <p>Line length equals the area of the field. Inserting a line break symbol                            each sqrt(length(string)) of symbols will produce a readable
                            depiction of the field.</p>

                        <p>The first line symbol corresponds with the cell located in the bottom left corner and has the coordinates [0, 0]. In this example, this is the position of the snake's head
                            (symbol ▲) — [13, 10], and stone (symbol ☻) - [7, 12].</p>

                        <p>If the client is made using your chosen software development language,
                            you will have a chance to use a more high-level API: 
                            Board — incapsulating the line with useful methods for searching elements on the board, and
                            YourSolver — an empty class with one method — you'll have to fill it with smart logic.</p>
                        <p>The game is a step-by-step process which has the server send its client (bot)
                            the present state of the updated field, and then wait for the response of the command for the snake.
                            Within the next second the player much give a command to the snake.
                            If they don't manage to give one in time, the snake will move automatically (until it finds a wall).</p>
                        <p>There are several commands: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT which lead to turning the snake's head
                            in the required direction. I would like to remind you that the snake moves mechanically under its own inertia.</p>
                        <p>First, make the snake listen to your commands. If there is no client for your language, 
                               it becomes slightly more complicated — you will have to write a WebSocket for the client. 
                            Thus, you prepare for the main game. Your next job is to write a bot 
                            which will follow a specific strategy on the field and will win.</p>
